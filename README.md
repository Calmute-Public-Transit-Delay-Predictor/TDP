# Public Transport Delay Predictor

## Overview

This project aims to predict potential delays in public transport (buses, trains, etc.) in the Waterloo, Ontario region. It leverages various factors to provide more accurate estimated arrival times and inform commuters about potential disruptions.

## Factors Considered

The predictor takes into account the following factors:

* **Historical Data:** Past travel times and delay occurrences for specific routes and times.
* **Weather Data:** Current and forecasted weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, temperature) which can impact travel times.
* **Construction/Development:** Ongoing roadwork or infrastructure projects in the vicinity of transport routes.
* **Seasonal Factors:** Regular variations in traffic and ridership due to different times of the year (e.g., school terms, summer vacations).
* **Festivities and Big Crowds:** Planned events, festivals, or large gatherings that might increase traffic or pedestrian activity near transport routes.
* **Public Holidays:** Reduced service schedules and potential for increased leisure travel on public holidays.

### 🚌 Public Transport Delay Predictor

## 📋 Overview  
This project aims to predict potential delays in public transport (buses, trains, etc.) in the **Waterloo, Ontario** region. It leverages various factors to provide more accurate estimated arrival times and inform commuters about potential disruptions.

## 📊 Factors Considered  
The predictor takes into account the following factors:

- 🕒 **Historical Data**: Past travel times and delay occurrences for specific routes and times.  
- 🌧️ **Weather Data**: Current and forecasted weather conditions (rain, snow, fog, temperature) which can impact travel times.  
- 🚧 **Construction/Development**: Ongoing roadwork or infrastructure projects in the vicinity of transport routes.  
- 📆 **Seasonal Factors**: Regular variations in traffic and ridership due to different times of the year (e.g., school terms, summer vacations).  
- 🎉 **Festivities and Big Crowds**: Planned events, festivals, or large gatherings that might increase traffic or pedestrian activity near transport routes.  
- 🏖️ **Public Holidays**: Reduced service schedules and potential for increased leisure travel.
